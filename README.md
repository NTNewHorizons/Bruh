## 1. Overview

Bruh Bot is a single-file Discord bot written in Python using `discord.py` 2.x. It is designed to be lightweight and easy to self-host - everything is configured via a single plain-text file (`config.txt`) with no database required.

Its core purpose is to add personality to a Discord server: it fires off random text responses, reacts to mentions, auto-threads posts in designated channels, and includes a small community feature set.

| Feature | Description | Toggle |
|---|---|---|
| Random Messages | Randomly replies to any message based on a configured probability | `ENABLE_RANDOM_MESSAGES` |
| Mention Responses | Replies whenever the bot is @mentioned | `ENABLE_MENTION_RESPONSES` |
| Message Suggestions | Members can suggest new messages; a moderator approves/rejects them | `ENABLE_SUGGESTIONS` |
| Rape Command | Context-menu command that posts a message to a designated channel | `ENABLE_RAPE_COMMAND` |
| Auto-Thread | Auto-creates a thread and adds reactions to posts in a channel | `ENABLE_AUTO_THREAD` |
| Chicken Out | Detects members who leave shortly after joining and posts a gif | `ENABLE_CHICKEN_OUT` |
| !hbm | Sends `misc/hbm.png` to the current channel | *(prefix command)* |
| **LLM Responses** | Bot can reply with AI‑generated text when mentioned with a prompt | `ENABLE_LLM` |

---

## 2. Requirements

- **Python 3.10 or later** - required for the `X | Y` type union syntax used throughout the code.
- **discord.py 2.x** - the async Discord library.
- **A Discord Bot Token** - from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
- The bot needs the **MESSAGE CONTENT** and **SERVER MEMBERS** Privileged Gateway Intents enabled in the Developer Portal.

> **⚠️ Important:** Privileged intents must be turned **ON** in the Developer Portal under **Bot → Privileged Gateway Intents**, otherwise the bot will fail to start.

---

## 3. Installation & First Run

### Install dependencies

```bash
pip install discord.py

# or with a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install discord.py
```

### Generate config

Run the bot once with no `config.txt` present - it will create a template and exit:

```bash
python bot.py
```

Output:
```
❌ 'config.txt' not found. Creating template...
✅ Template created. Fill in your values and restart.
```

### Edit config.txt

Open `config.txt` and fill in at minimum:

- `TOKEN` - your bot token.
- `AUTHORIZED_USER_ID` - your Discord user ID (right-click your name → Copy User ID with Developer Mode on).
- Any channel/role IDs for the features you want to enable.

### Start the bot

```bash
python bot.py
```

Successful start output:
```
🚀 Starting Bruh Bot...
✅ Loaded 12 messages from default_msgs.txt
✅ Loaded 8 messages from mention_msgs.txt
✅ BruhBot#1234 is online!
🔄 Slash commands synced.
```

| `LOG_FILE` | Filename for the main chat log. |


---

## 5. Message Files

The bot reads two plain-text files at startup. If they do not exist they are created as empty files automatically.

- `default_msgs.txt` - messages sent randomly to any channel.
- `mention_msgs.txt` - messages sent when the bot is @mentioned.

```
# default_msgs.txt example
bruh
imagine
https://tenor.com/view/some-gif-12345
ratio
```

**Rules:**
- One message per line.
- Lines starting with `#` are treated as comments and ignored.
- Blank lines are ignored.
- Messages can be plain text, Discord markdown, or URLs (images/GIFs work).
- Duplicates are silently ignored when added via the suggestion system.

> **ℹ️ Hot-reload:** Use `/reload-msgs` to pick up file changes without restarting the bot.

---

## 6. Features

### 6.1 Random Messages

When `ENABLE_RANDOM_MESSAGES=true`, the bot rolls a random number between 1 and `RANDOM_MESSAGE_CHANCE` on every message it sees. If the result is 1, it picks a random line from `default_msgs.txt` and sends it to the same channel.

> **⚠️ Note:** The bot processes every message in every server it is in. Keep `RANDOM_MESSAGE_CHANCE` reasonably high (≥50) to avoid being spammy.

---

### 6.2 Mention Responses

When `ENABLE_MENTION_RESPONSES=true`, any message that @mentions the bot triggers a response. The bot picks a random line from `mention_msgs.txt` and sends it.

> If `mention_msgs.txt` is empty, no response is sent and no error is raised.

---

### 6.3 Message Suggestions

The suggestion system lets any server member propose a new message for the bot's response pool. There are two ways to submit:

- **Right-click context menu:** right-click any message → Apps → **Suggest message**. The text content of that message is forwarded.
- **Slash command:** `/suggest-msg <your message>`

Both methods post an embed to `SUGGESTION_CHANNEL_ID` and ping `SUGGESTION_PING_ROLE_ID`. The embed contains action buttons visible only to `AUTHORIZED_USER_ID`:

| Button | Action |
|---|---|
| ❌ Reject | Discards the suggestion. The embed is struck through. |
| ✅ Default | Adds the message to `default_msgs.txt`. |
| ✅ Mention | Adds the message to `mention_msgs.txt`. |
| ✅ Both | Adds the message to both files. |

> **ℹ️ Note:** If a message already exists in the target file, the button reports a warning but does not create a duplicate.

---

### 6.4 Rape Command

When `ENABLE_RAPE_COMMAND=true`, a context-menu command called **Rape member** appears when right-clicking a server member (Apps → Rape member). It posts a message to `RAPE_CHANNEL_ID` in the form:

```
@invoker raped @target
```

> **⚠️ Caution:** This command is disabled by default. Enable it only if it fits your community's culture and guidelines.

---

### 6.5 Auto-Thread Channel

When `ENABLE_AUTO_THREAD=true`, every message posted in `AUTO_THREAD_CHANNEL_ID` automatically:

1. Receives a ✅ and ❌ reaction.
2. Gets a thread created using the first 100 characters of the message as the thread name.
3. The author is mentioned inside the new thread, then that ping is immediately deleted (so they get a notification without visual clutter).

> **ℹ️ Required permissions:** The bot must have **Manage Threads** and **Add Reactions** permissions in that channel.

---

### 6.6 Chicken Out Detection

When `ENABLE_CHICKEN_OUT=true`, the bot records a timestamp when each member joins. If that member leaves within `CHICKEN_OUT_TIMEOUT` seconds, the bot posts to `CHICKEN_OUT_CHANNEL_ID`:

```
@MemberName chickened out
<CHICKENED_OUT_MSG>
```

> The tracking is in-memory only. Members who joined before a restart will not trigger chicken-out detection.

---

### 6.7 !hbm Command

A simple prefix command. When a user types `!hbm`, the bot sends `misc/hbm.png` to the current channel.

The `misc/` folder must be in the same directory as `bot.py`. If the file is missing, the bot replies with an error message.

---

### 6.8 LLM Responses

If `ENABLE_LLM=true`, the bot can answer with AI‑generated text when mentioned with extra content. For example:

```
@Bruh tell me a joke about ducks
```

The text after the mention is sent to the configured LLM provider (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) along with a system prompt that defines Bruh’s personality. The response is posted back into the same channel.

Key behaviors:

- If the mention contains *no* additional text the bot falls back to a random line from `mention_msgs.txt`.
- You can enable `LLM_PERCENTAGE` to make the bot only answer some of the time.
- Failures/timeouts either emit an error or, if `LLM_FALLBACK_ON_ERROR=true`, a random mention message or custom `LLM_FALLBACK_MSG`.
- Conversation history is remembered per user/channel; use `/clear-memory` to wipe it.

> **⚠️** LLM integration requires network access to the provider and may incur usage costs. Test with `/llm-status` and watch the logs in `logs/` if enabled.

## 8. Folder Structure

```
bot.py                  ← main bot file (single file)
config.txt              ← configuration (auto-generated on first run)
default_msgs.txt        ← default random response messages
mention_msgs.txt        ← mention response messages
misc/
└── hbm.png             ← image used by !hbm command
logs/                   ← conversation and error logs (if enabled)
```

---

## 9. Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---|---|
| Login failed / Invalid TOKEN | Double-check `TOKEN` in `config.txt`. Regenerate it in the Developer Portal if needed. |
| Slash commands not showing up | They can take up to an hour to propagate globally. Re-invite the bot or wait. |
| Suggestions not posting | Ensure `SUGGESTION_CHANNEL_ID` and `SUGGESTION_PING_ROLE_ID` are set and the bot has Send Messages permission there. |
| Auto-thread silently failing | The bot needs **Manage Threads** + **Add Reactions** in `AUTO_THREAD_CHANNEL_ID`. Check channel permission overrides. |
| Bot responds to its own messages | Should not happen - the `on_message` guard returns early for `bot.user`. Check for other bots forwarding messages. |
| Chicken out fires on restart | By design - the in-memory join log is cleared on restart. Pre-restart members are not tracked. |
| !hbm returns "file not found" | Create the `misc/` folder next to `bot.py` and put `hbm.png` inside it. |
| LLM messages not working | Verify `ENABLE_LLM`, provider settings, and that the service is reachable (`/llm-status`). Check network/firewall. |
| Your conversation feels broken | Use `/clear-memory` to reset your LLM history for the channel. |
| Message not added after approval | The message may already be in the file. The button warns but will not duplicate. |
